WHAT IS IT?
 
TeenHub is a place for teenagers, ages 13-18, to find places to volunteer their services and/or participate in activities.
 

WHAT IS OUR GOAL?
 
TeenHub’s goal is to give teenagers the opportunity to become friends through activities they are interested in and at the same time serve their community in a positive way.
 
 
REASON IT WAS BUILT
 
TeenHub realizes that there are teenagers in and around Jackson that are looking for a place to “fit in.”  That is what this website is designed for.  We want every teenager to find a place where they feel comfortable and a place they can make friends.
